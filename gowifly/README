Warning, this code is not suitable for anything at the moment. It is under heavy
development.

# Usage

This code attempts to normalize the state of the WiFly during setup. It does
this by running a few blank lines and attempting to exit command mode. This
means that we know that the WiFly should begin in data mode. *However*, if the
module has a connection open, or is utilizing data mode for anything, this data
will be sent to data mode. The library makes the assumption that the module
should be in a clean state, but normalizes the data/command state for
convenience.

# TODO

timeouts
flushing serial line
should we reboot the module at beginning?
